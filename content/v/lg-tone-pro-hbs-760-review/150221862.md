Therefore having audio transmitted into both ears is truly a better experience VS having a mono single earpiece.\n\n-Lightweight and tend to forget they are around my neck\n\n-Battery life on these things are pretty amazing. I purchased these things about a week ago and I\u2019m still on the same charge.\n\n-I\u2019m able to connect 2 bluetooth devices to this headset.\n\n-Call quality is GREAT. \n\nMy Personal Dis-Likes\n-The speaker cable can sometimes be annoying\n\n-The magnets for the ear piece could be a little bit stronger. \n\n-When listening to music, I wish these offered a little more bass.\n\n==================================================\n\nSite: http:\/\/LewisBeasley.com\nTwitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/boneceo\nGoogle Plus: http:\/\/www.google.com\/+lewisbeasley\nYouTube: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/streamlewis\nInstagram: http:\/\/instagram.com\/boneceo\n\nMy Amazon Wishlist - http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/registry\/wishlist\/ref=wish_list\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nYou should watch: \"Touch and pair headphones!\" \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=h8ls-yXirUk\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-",
