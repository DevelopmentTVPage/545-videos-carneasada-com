    "description": "This is quick unboxing of a Seagate Expansion USB 3.0 5TB desktop hard drive purchased from Argos for \u00a3129.99 today, I thought I would do a quick unboxing video - since I was un-boxing it anyway to use for backup and double-copies of my video archive and uploads, 4K video files can take up lots and of storage space quite fast.\n\nRecorded Using A Samsung Galaxy SIII LTE.",
