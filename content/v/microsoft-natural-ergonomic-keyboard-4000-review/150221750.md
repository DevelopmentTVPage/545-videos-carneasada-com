Amazing keyboard for people who have pain using standard keyboards! Keyboard is wired using USB plug, 104 keys, including media control keys, and a scroll wheel. There is a wrist rest, two fold out feet and led indicator lights. Very good keyboard for the money, its quiet, feels good and looks nice! Please Sub!\n\nThanks for watching!",
