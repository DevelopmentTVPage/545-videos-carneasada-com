    "description": "Archeagus takes a look at the setup, productivity and gameplay aspects of the new Dell U3415W monitor.\nUPDATE: The TUSB3410 issue seems to be a conflict specific to my system configuration. No other Dell customers have reported any similar problems at this time.\nSecond UPDATE: I've attempted to capture an image of the backlight bleed but the results I get exaggerate and emphasize the bleed to appear worse than what I perceive in person. This Reddit link has a better image of the bleed than I've been able to produce and discusses its actual impact during use.
