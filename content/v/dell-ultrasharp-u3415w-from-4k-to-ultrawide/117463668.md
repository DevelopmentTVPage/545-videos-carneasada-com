    "description": "I decided it was time to add to my 2x Samsung 28\" 4k Monitors and get a high quality ultra wide for my gaming and main monitor. I found one in the Dell U3415W and I could not be happier with my purchase. This thing can even overclock, my model got all the way up to 80hz which is insane!!!!",
