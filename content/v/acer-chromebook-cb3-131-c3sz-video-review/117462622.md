    "description": "Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ - http:\/\/prourls.co\/bvZd\n\nThis is an 11\" Chromebook in a plastic white shell that sports an Intel Celeron N2840 2.16 GHz processor, has 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage.  But as a Chromebook you pretty much have everything stored in the cloud anyway.  Think of it like a Chrome browser as an OS and you have everything Internet related at your fingertips.\n\nIt connects to Wi-Fi at startup and you log into the Chromebook with your Google account.  Websites load fast, Netflix playback is good, screen resolution at 1366 x 768 pixels is sharp on the 11\" screen, battery life is excellent at over 8 hours tested.  It also supports Wireless AC as well as BGN.\n\nOctane Score is 8934 in testing, really impressed with this  less than $200 Chromebook and highly recommended.
