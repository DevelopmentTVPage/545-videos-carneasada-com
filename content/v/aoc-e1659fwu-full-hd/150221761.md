Users can enjoy a dual monitor set-up in an instant. The display comes with a sleeve, which makes it even easier to carry the lightweight (1.2 kg) display. For even more convenience, the monitor stand can be rotated, allowing to choose between a landscape or portrait orientation (pivot) \u2013 useful for desktop presentations, document viewing, texts or mail clients. If you want to enhance your workspace and efficiency wherever you go, the e1659Fwu is the right choice!",
