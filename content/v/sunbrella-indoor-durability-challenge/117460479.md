    "description": "In this edition of the Sunbrella Durability Challenge, our fearless Sunbrella quality control technicians take on two messy tween girls determined to leave their mark on white Sunbrella indoor upholstery \nfabric using their weapons of choice: chocolate syrup, colorful markers and blueberry topping. Watch as they wash away each sloppy salvo, leaving the sofa and pillows pristine.\n\nLearn more about how interior designer Kate Jackson used Sunbrella fabric to create a family friendly, coastal chic design in the Perspective New England Beach House. It\u2019s part of the Perspective New England video series, a design journey exploring the versatility of Sunbrella fabrics for every aspect of your life\u2014at home, on the water or on an adventure. Also check out The Rhode Yacht, a 1977 Airstream Argosy transformed by Sunbrella, and The Real Yacht, a Morris Yachts M36 sailing yacht brought to life with Sunbrella.
