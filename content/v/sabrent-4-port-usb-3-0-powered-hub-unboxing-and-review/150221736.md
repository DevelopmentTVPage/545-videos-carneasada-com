    "description": "The Sabrent 4-Port USB 3.0 Hub is unboxed this week on Jenny Fedora Reviews.  This $30 USB hub is perfect to travel and used with USB devices that require more power!\n\nAmazon Link: https:\/\/amzn.com\/B00TPMEOYM\n_________________________________________\nFrom the Manufacture:\n\n4 Ports (output); 1 Port (input)\nBlue LED indicates power status for each port\nSupports transfer speeds up to  5Gbps (USB 3.0), 480Mbps (USB 2.0), 12Mbps (USB 1.1)\n2.5 Amp power adapter included to power up high powered devices.\nEasy to setup: Plug & Play and Hot Swappable\n\nAdd up to 4 peripherals quickly and easily with the Sabrent 4-Port USB 3.0 Hub. The thin, lightweight design makes this hub a great travel companion to expand one USB 3.0 port into four. Especially great for notebooks which come with only a few ports in an era when you need to attach many USB devices at once, such as a printer, card reader, cell phone, iPod, thumb drive, mouse, keyboard, or an external hard drive. Fully backwards compatible with the USB 2.0\/1.1 products. Plus, each port has its own separate power switch so you can control each port independently. \n\n\nExpand your high speed USB 3.0 ports \nTechnology seems to advance at ever increasing speeds. With the recent release of SuperSpeed USB 3.0, you can now transfer data at up to 10 times the speeds of the older USB 2.0 standards! Speeds of 5Gbps are a vast improvement over USB 2.0 that only supports up to 480Mbps. The Sabrent USB 3.0 Hub is a great tool to expand a single USB 3.0 port into 4 ports, so now you can connect all of your USB devices at one time. Plus, its small and elegant design has been configured to be as thin as possible so as to not take up precious space as you travel. Yet, it is still backward compatible with your older devices, so you can still use it in conjunction with USB 2.0 devices. \n\nSystem Requirements: \n\n* Windows 2000\/XP\/Vista\/7\/8\/8.1\/10 \n* Mac OS X \n_________________________________________\n\nWebsite: http:\/\/www.jennyfedora.com\nFacebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/JennyFedoraProductions\nGab: https:\/\/gab.ai\/jennyfedora\nTwitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/Jenny_Fedora\n\nMusic: http:\/\/www.bensound.com\/royalty-free-music\n_________________________________________\n\nLike and Subscribe!\nJenny Fedora Reviews: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/JennyFedoraReviews\nJenny Fedora (Let's Play): https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/JennyFedora",
