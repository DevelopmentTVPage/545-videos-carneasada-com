    "description": "In this video I demonstrate how well Kaspersky Total Security 2017 detects 1,000 different malware files in a signature-based scan.\n\nOur complete review of Kaspersky with lots of other in-house tests, graphs, and detailed information on the products can be found here: https:\/\/fatsecurity.com\/review\/kaspersky\n\nThis test ONLY evaluates the signature-based scanner implemented in the various Kaspersky security products for home users. It does not test for how Kaspersky detects and removes active malicious malware. \n\nAs you can learn from the review on our site, Kaspersky offers a variety of additional features and holds stronger abilities than a mere signature-based scan.\n\nBefore I begin each test I like to quickly discuss current threats, means of infection, types of malware and how malware operates in general.\n\nYou can skip my explanation about malware types and various online threats if you feel like enough of a malware guru from all our previous videos.\n\nGo to 7:55 to watch how I configure Kaspersky Total Security 2017 for the test and the test process itself - without any beating around the bush.\n\n------------------------------\n\nThe malware I'm scanning hasn't been activated, but nonetheless it's a collection of relatively fresh files and represents the ever-changing \"threatscape\" very well.\n\nKaspersky continues to impress our team in all the tests we conduct, and it was no different for its malware detection score.\n\nWe rate Kaspersky as a top choice antivirus provider based on all our hands-on tests performed in-house, as well as third-party scores provided by independent antivirus labs.\n\nIf you want to view all the scores on a beautifully laid out presentation, use our special lab tests aggregator tool: https:\/\/fatsecurity.com\/tools\/test-results-calculator\n\nSet the year tab to the last 2-3 years so that you get the most recent indication of test scores and ratings.\n\n------------------------------\n\nComment on this video to let us know what you think of this video, and where you'd like to see improvements or any other information.\n\nDon't forget to subscribe to our channel for updates of new videos to stay in the loop about the latest antivirus software trends.\n\nVisit our site and social media pages for more expert antivirus reviews and aggregated unbiased test scores.",
