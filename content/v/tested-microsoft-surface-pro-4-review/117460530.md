The device is every bit an improvement over last year's model, packing an Intel Skylake processor into a chassis that's even thinner than the Atom-based Surface tablet. Its screen, keyboard, and stylus are also better, and we test it in the hands of working artists. \n\nThanks to Marty Cooper for helping with this test.
