    "description": "This is an introduction to the TI-84 Plus CE calculator from Texas Instruments.  I purchased this from The Bach Company (www.bachcompany.com) and it was delivered last night.  \n\nKey Features:\n* Slim Design\n* 154K RAM, the most for any version of the TI-83\/84 by far\n* Color Screen\n* Rechargeable Battery, which uses the standard Mini USB cable\n* Same interface to the TI-84+ family, it is ready to go right out of the box\n\nCaution: this movie was done early in the morning and I had not had my morning coffee.  \n\nFull review to be posted soon on my blog, edspi31415.blogspot.com.",
