Leave a like above if you like the quality this time around! :)\n\nCheck out all my iPad Air 2 videos here: http:\/\/full.sc\/1rhG72o\n\nIn this video, we give a full review of the next generation of Apple's iPad Air tablet, the iPad Air 2. Alongside a slightly-modified design to make the tablet thinner and lighter, this tablet packs an all-new A8X processor, as well as Touch ID\/Apple Pay, slo-mo video\/burst photo mode, and a Gold color option. After using the new tablet for just a few days, we can really appreciate some of the best features using them to their full potential, with a faster processor clocked at 2GB RAM, faster Wi-Fi connectivity and longer-lasting battery, all packed into a slightly thinner and lighter build.\n\n--------------------\n\nSubscribe here: http:\/\/full.sc\/12f1LNP\n\nTwitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/MikesiOSHelp\nFacebook: http:\/\/facebook.com\/MikesiOSHelp\nInstagram: http:\/\/instagram.com\/mike.cronin\nGoogle Plus: http:\/\/full.sc\/1s33ZIC\nSite: http:\/\/mikesioshelp.org",
