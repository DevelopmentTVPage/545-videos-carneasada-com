It's a budget mouse that has some very good features built in.\nIt sells for around \u00a320 and above on Amazon.\nIt has Hyper Scrolling, Forward\/Back Buttons, Left\/Right Scroll, it's really comfortable to use and all the buttons can be customised and tweaked within the SetPoint Software.\n\nPlease subscribe for future tech reviews of all kinds.\n\nCheck out my links:\n\nwww.youtube.com\/yonitechvids\nwww.geekslam.co.uk",
