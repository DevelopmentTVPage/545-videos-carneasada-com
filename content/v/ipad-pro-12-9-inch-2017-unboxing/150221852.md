    "description": "Apple has released updated iPad Pro models... and I have the updated 12.9 inch version! I decided to upgrade from an iPad Air 2 to the 12.9 inch iPad Pro so I could enjoy the larger screen size. And with all the enhancements for iPad coming to iOS 11, I figured this was the perfect time. So far, I am loving the new iPad Pro. The bigger screen is very useful, especially for multitasking. The ProMotion display with the higher refresh rate is so smooth. And I also got the Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard, which truly make it a full computing experience. All in all, I am very happy with it. Enjoy the unboxing!",
