    "description": "A video on unboxing, review and  USB speed tests for the Lexar JumpDrive S75 USB 3.0 128GB flash drive . I've ran drive speed tests on the Lexar USB 3.0 flash with USB Flash Benchmark and Crystal Diskmark v503 64bit apps. Both flash drive speed test software apps ran smoothly on the Lexar flash drive S75 USB 3.0 128GB. Speed results were faster than I had hope they would be on a budget flash drive.\n\nUSB speed can be determine through USB speed test on USB 3.1, USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 flash drives, jumbdrives and pendrives of any brand and storage capacity. My video shows USB 3.0 speed test results on a Lexar 128GB drive that ranks just about equal to the SanDisk Ultra USB 3.0 flash drive.\n\nIn the real world:\nUSB 3.0 speed test on the Lexar jumpdrive proves that it is faster then your top speed on a USB 2.0 flash drive. USB 3.0 can have data transfer speeds up to around 280MB\/s while top USB 2.0 speeds are around 50MB\/s.",
