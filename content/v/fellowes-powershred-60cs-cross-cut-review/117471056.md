    "description": "Here I review the Fellowes powershred 60Cs cross-cut personal shredder with Safesense Technology. \n\nThis shredder is suitable for your home and office. It protects against identity fraud by shredding ten sheets per pass into 4 x 50mm cross-cut particles shredding each sheet of A4 paper into over 300 particles. The 60Cs also shreds staples, paper clips and credit cards. For additional safety SafeSense technology that stops shredding when hands touch the paper entry for added peace of mind. The 60Cs shreds continuously for up to 7 minutes and the 22 L bin with a lift-off head makes emptying the bin easy.",
