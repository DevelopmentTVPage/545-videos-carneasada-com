    "description": "The Acer Aspire One comes with a Celeron N3060 processor, 2 GB of DDR3 RAM, Intel HD graphics, and 32 GB of eMMC storage. This laptop cost me \u00a3160 from Tesco's, though you may pay up to \u00a3200 in other shops. Its designed for basic tasks such as web browsing, or things like Microsoft Office, et cetera. Don't expect to do anything demanding with this laptop, and also bear in mind Windows 10 will take up at least 10 GB of storage after updates, so you won't have a lot of space to store any files such as videos or pictures. Overall, I really like the laptop for the money and it has great battery life of up to 9 hours.",
