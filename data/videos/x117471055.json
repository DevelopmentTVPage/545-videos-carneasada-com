    "description": "A very quick unboxing and demonstration of the Fellowes Powershred 60Cs 10-Sheet Cross-Cut Paper and Credit Card Shredder with SafeSense Technology (4606001)\n\nWorks very well out of the box.  It says that it has a 10 sheet capacity but I thought it might break down when I shredded that many pages at once.  I would stick to just 4 or 5 pages at a time, just to avoid jams or wearing out the machine prematurely.  Requires maintenance with some regular oiling.  Fellowes Powershred Performance Shredder Oil (35250) is recommend for regular lubrication treatments. I will update review in about 6 months to see how she is holding up.  Other shredders I have had in the past have broken down very quickly.  \n\nFollow me of Facebook: \nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/RC-Beach-Flyer-928048697250962\/\n\nfellowes powershred 60cs",
