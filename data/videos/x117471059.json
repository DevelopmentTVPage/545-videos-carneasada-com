    "description": "The new Galaxy Tab S2 8.0 is the World's Thinnest & Lightest tablet! \n\nCombining a 8\" high-resolution sAMOLED display with an unbelievably small and compact form factor - the S2 8.0 is one of the nicest looking tablets I've ever used.\n\nIt's not perfect - it doesn't have the latest Android 6 software, nor the most powerful hardware inside and the battery life is disappointing. However, find out why I still think the S2 is the best Android tablet on the market right now.\n\nIf you're interested in buying this - would you consider going via my Amazon link?
