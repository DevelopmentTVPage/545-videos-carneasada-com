This is the non-retina version. This unit has 16GB of storage capacity and is white and silver. This unit is only equipped with a Wifi antenna but there's also a cellular data version available. \n\nLets take a look around the device. \n\nThe main advantage of the iPad mini has always been its size. Its a very comfortable size to hold with one hand and is lighter than two of its direct competitors the Galaxy Note 8 and the Galaxy tab 3. This is pretty impressive considering that the iPad mini is made mostly out of aluminum while the other two tablets are made out of plastic.  However, it is a tad bit heavier than the new nexus 7, though the nexus 7 only has a 7 \" screen. Its a great as a media consumption device for one person.\n(mini 312g) (note 8 340g) (tab 3 312g)(nexus 7 290g)\n\nOn the software side it comes with all the major updates of iOS 7 such as control center and notification center and cleaner fonts and refreshed icons.\n\nAnd while this device still uses the last generation A5 chip its still very fluid, responsive and smooth. However, we did notice that device is a teeny bit slower than the new iPad air which sports the new A7 64 bit processor. And while the web-browsing experience is exceptional, in that pages load up fast, scrolling is smooth and pinch to zoom is fluid, the iPad air is just marginally faster than the mini at all these tasks. But this isn't to say that the iPad mini is not a fast or smooth tablet...really just an observation.\n\nWhile the screen is not a Retina display, the colors are exceptionally well-rendered and the images are sharp. The screen is also very bright and has a very wide range of viewing angles. Probably the widest range on any tablet we've seen so far. The iPad mini is also very responsive to touch as you'll see in this little test.\n\nVideos from youtube also played very smoothly and the performance of the screen made it truly a pleasure to watch. Now we've set the volume to 100%, so you can hear how it sounds. \n\nVideo from web streaming services like Netflix also played back very smoothly. \n\nNow, we mentioned this in our review of the iPad Air as well. In the horizontal orientation, its very easy to cover the speaker grill with your hand and this can muffle the sound quality.\n\nAs expected, the iPad mini handles 3-D gaming flawlessly as you can see here. No frames were dropped and it really responded very accurately to input. The size of the iPad mini is also very well suited to being used as a gaming console.\n\n \nAnother notable addition to the mini is that Apple now gives away its suite or iWork Apps for free with any new iPad mini you buy. Pages is a great substitute for Word, Keynote works well in place and powerpoint and Numbers is an acceptable replacement for Excel. You also get the iLife Apps such as iMovie, iPhoto and Garage Band for free. And these are handy tools for aspiring musicians and people looking to edit movies and photos inexpensively. \n\nThe 5MP rear-facing camera is one of the best cameras on any tablet we've tested so far, as you can see in this test shot. The front facing camera is also very usable and crisp. However, both cameras are nowhere as good as most high-end smartphone cameras.\n\nThe Wifi signal was strong and reliable as expected.\n\nThe device's battery life is extremely impressive. When playing back hd video from youtube, the device lasted _ on a single charge. And most people should be able to go several days without charging the device, when used for a mixture of web browsing, watching videos or playing games.\n\nSo overall the iPad mini is a very reliable, well-built device that performs almost flawlessly. It is still one of the best tablets in the 8\" tablet market. Now there are less expensive alternatives. The Galaxy tab 3 8\" is a direct competitor while the new Nexus 7 offers a solid performance, though it has a smaller screen. But if you looking for a reliable, consistent tablet that just works all the time, the iPad mini is an excellent choice. \n\nIf you own the iPad Mini, tell us what you think.
