No other Dell customers have reported any similar problems at this time.\nSecond UPDATE: I've attempted to capture an image of the backlight bleed but the results I get exaggerate and emphasize the bleed to appear worse than what I perceive in person. This Reddit link has a better image of the bleed than I've been able to produce and discusses its actual impact during use.
