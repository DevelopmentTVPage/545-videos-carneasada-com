    "description": "The latest Amazon Fire 7 Tablet 2017 edition unboxing and quick first impressions of the $50 budget tablet running fire os, and including Amazon's virtual assistant, Alexa. It still remains to be seen if this improved version can compete with other budget android tablets in its class.\n\nThis is just a quick overview of the tablet, and I plan on doing a full review sometime in the near future.
