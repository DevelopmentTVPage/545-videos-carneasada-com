    "description": "The Xperia XA is Sony's entry-level 2016 smartphone. On paper, the 5-inch 720p display, 13MP camera, MediaTek processor & 2GB of RAM may not be the most advanced. But the XA's thin, lightweight and comfortable design makes it feel great in the hand and look stylish thanks to almost edge bezels. It may be a budget phone, but it's better looking than the Xperia X and XP. \n\nThe Xperia XA is due out in Summer 2016 but prices are still TBC. If you enjoy my videos, please like & subscribe :)",
