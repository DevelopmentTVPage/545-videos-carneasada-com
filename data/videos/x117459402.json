    "description": "Well-designed and made ergonomic wireless peripherals with dedicated Windows controls. And although far from cheap they offer a good feature set at a decent price. The mouse didn't work brilliantly in our tests, but that may be an issue with Bluetooth interference, and we love the keyboard. Definitely worth considering if you require ergonomic peripherals.",
