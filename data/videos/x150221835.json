    "description": "Buy it on Amazon - http:\/\/lon.tv\/9asmt (affiliate link) - Lexar has a nice USB flash drive that doubles as a charger for iOS devices. But while it can download YouTube content it doesn't solve the problem of playing DRM protected iTunes content. Subscribe for more!  http:\/\/lon.tv\/s\n\nVIDEO INDEX:\n00:15 - Charging an iPhone with the flash drive\n01:56 - Copying files from a computer\n03:22 - Playing video content back from the external C20i\n04:08 - Attempt to play protected iTunes movie from c20i\n04:35 - Copy files from an iPhone to the external c20i \n05:02 - iPad landscape issues\n05:31 - Playing back 4k content from the external c20i\n06:10 - Downloading YouTube content onto the C20i for offline play\n08:23 - Audio recorder and text editor\n09:09 - Disk speed benchmark for reads and writes\n09:30 - Conclusion and final thoughts\n\nOn one end of the C20i is a USB 3.0 connector for PC's. The other end is a lightning adapter for iOS devices like the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad. Plugging an iOS device into the c20i while connected to a PC or Mac will charge the iOS device.\n\nWhen connected only to an iOS device files on the C20i can be accessed via a free app from Lexar. The app will play back video and audio files and has some limited note taking and recording capabilities. \n\nUnfortunately this won't solve the problem of playing back protected content that was purchased from iTunes or another online service. So this won't be a solution for offloading iTunes store purchases from an iPad or iPhone - the app simply can't play the files even if they are copied to the C20i from a computer. Non protected video files played back fine, including some MKV files encoded with the open source x.264 codec.Your mileage will vary of course.\n\nThe ability to download YouTube content to the device is interesting - especially given that it doesn't require a lot of effort to make work. Just playing back the video on YouTube from within the Lexar app will download it the iPad or iPhone and it can then be copied over to the C20i. The only downside to this is that it will eat up the iOS device's storage until the file is moved to the C20i.\n\nThe app itself feels a bit clunky and buggy. It does not have a landscape mode for its interface (although movies do play back in landscape mode). Additionally the app is not compatible with iOS extensions so it's not possible to edit and save files from external applications like Apple's Pages or Numbers.\n\nLexar formatted the c20i with the Fat32 file format. This limits file sizes to 4GB each - not enough for HD movies. I was able to reformat the drive to exFAT and still have it be accessible by my iPad and iPhone.\n\nBottom line? It's no worse than its competition and in some ways a little bit better. Like its competitors it won't play protected iTunes files and as such will not solve the problem that many consumers researching this product are hoping to solve.\n\nSubscribe to my email list to get a weekly digest of upcoming videos! - http:\/\/lon.tv\/email\n\nVisit the Lon.TV store to purchase some of my previously reviewed items! http:\/\/lon.tv\/store\n\nRead more about my transparency and disclaimers: http:\/\/lon.tv\/disclosures\n\nWant to chat with other fans of the channel?
