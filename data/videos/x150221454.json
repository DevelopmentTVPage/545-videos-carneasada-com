    "description": "\"We treat the people of the world as our family.  We want you to be safe and live the healthiest life possible.  You can rest assured that our products aren't polluting the air inside your home. VOC's are chemicals that become a gas at room temperature. As a result, products made with formaldehyde will release the gas into the air. This is called off-gassing. If high concentrations of formaldehyde are off-gassed and breathed in, it could cause health problems.  There is no formaldehyde in our products.  We also use a water-based glue that is completely environmentally friendly, and recyclable too!\n\nAll our products are made from 99% recycled paper board and are formaldehyde free and VOC free. Its definitely safe for your family and our environment. It's easy to put together too! Super strong 3M heavy duty adhesive bonds the boards together.
