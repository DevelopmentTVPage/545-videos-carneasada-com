There are limited control buttons on the top of the physical printer.  Checking levels of ink and more is done via the Canon Selphy application.\n\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/pixmamg3620\n\nOverall, we liked the simplicity of the Canon Pixma MG3620 but hoped for an easier setup. Printing worked well from both Android and iOS devices. Also remember what paper you have loaded when you send items to print.  Cloud printing worked just as well when away form home and the document was there and waiting. The Pixma MG3620 always woke up and had the document ready.\n\nThe ink cartridges are not huge, so you will need to replace those often if you do a lot of printing.  I look at this printer for good 4x6\" glossy photo printing and limited documents.\n\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/pixmamg3620",
