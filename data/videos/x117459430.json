    "description": "Hey y'all and welcome to Sewspire! \n\nToday, I am here to show you how to sew a slipcover that will fit any standard metal folding chair. This particular design is unique because it can be styled in two ways to offer you more versatility.\n\nFor this project you will need 2 yards of cotton fabric. I suggest purchasing 1 yard each of two coordinating prints.\n\nTo begin, you will need to precut the following pieces of cotton fabric:\n\nCut two 33\" x 21\" pieces of cotton fabric\n\nCut two 18\" x 21\" pieces of cotton fabric\n\nCut one 18\" x 16\" piece of cotton fabric\n\nThis project comes together very quickly and can likely be accomplished in 15 to 30 minutes depending upon your sewing skill level.\n\nI hope you enjoy the video and will subscribe to my YouTube Channel and Newsletter. I'd love it if you shared pictures of your finished chair covers with me on Facebook and Instagram using #sewspire and @sewspire.\n\nI will be back next week with another inspired sewing project which will compliment our new chair slipcovers. Until then, the creative genius in me salutes the creative genius in you!\n\nXO,\n\nAndrea",
