    "description": "We recently bought a new house and I knew that I wanted a new desk and exactly where I wanted it. I took measurements and started looking. I kept this saved in my cart for probably two months before deciding to take the chance and buy it. Box it came in was really heavy and took two of us to get it to where we were going to put it together. I opened the box and did a full inventory and didn't find anything missing. I began putting this together and only need some assistance twice (When putting the top of the desk on and when securing the desk and side cabinet together). I think it took me about 3 hours to put together (I took my time to make sure I didn't make mistakes) ohh and I am also a woman. There is a lot of satisfaction walking by the piece now and knowing I put this together! I love this desk, it fits perfect in my space, and looks like I paid more than I did. The only thing I wish this had was a drawer to store pens and pencils in. However, I knew that it did not when I purchased this item so it does not affect my rating. Very modern and easily assembled with patience and time.",
